Question 4: What is a Django migration and why do we need them?
    Django's migrations are a means for you to propagate changes to your models (adding a field, removing a model, etc.) to your database schema.
    Database migration is critical since it aids in cost savings. Database migration has the advantage of 
    transferring data from an obsolete legacy system to more current software. 
    Moreover, Database migration unifies diverse data so that it may be accessed by many systems.
