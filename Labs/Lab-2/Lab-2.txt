Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
    First we import the socket library/module, with the method socket.socket by specifying the following 
    1. socket_family (AF_UNIX or AF_INET)
    2. socket_type (SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM)
    3. protocol which is usually 0
    In our case it's socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
    To be associated with a port, server sockets will call bind(). 
    They want to be linked to a port so that other applications may communicate with them. 
    Client sockets can call bind(), but they virtually never do so because it's not very useful.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
    By calling the setsockopt() method and specifying the following
    1. socket
    2. level
    3. option_name
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    SO_REUSEADDR allows us to reuse the same bind port

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
    We get the address of the connected client

Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
    recv() returns "Foobar"
